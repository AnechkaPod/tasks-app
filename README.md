Users are managed via a grid with inline editing

Tasks are assigned to users

Validation is handled both client-side and server-side

New records stay in edit mode until successfully saved

IDs are generated by the server

Deleted tasks are soft-deleted



\## Data Rules



Users:



UserId is a business identifier

Email must be unique

A user can have multiple tasks



Tasks

ID is auto-generated by the database

UserId is required

DueDate, Title, and Priority are required

Soft delete is used instead of physical delete



\## Notes / Future Improvements



Add automated tests

Improve error handling and logging

RabbitMQ for due date notifications
